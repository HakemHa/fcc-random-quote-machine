We just want their things."] , [" ~  Paul Stiles"], ["If the photographer is not a discoverer, he is not an artist." , " ~  Paul Strand"], ["Loneliness can be conquered only by those who can bear solitude." , " ~  Paul Tillich"], ["Being religious means asking passionately the question of the meaning of our existence and being willing to receive answers, even if the answers hurt." , " ~  Paul Tillich"], ["The principles which constitute the universe must be sought in man." , " ~  Paul Tillich"], ["If you do not have “courage to be,” you lose your own being." , " ~  Paul Tillich"], ["The character of human life, like the character of the human condition, like the character of all life, is “ambiguity:” the inseparable mixture of good and evil, true and false, the creative and destructive forces — both individual and social." , " ~  Paul Tillich"], ["Religion is the state of being grasped by an ultimate concern, a concern which qualifies all other concerns as preliminary and which itself contains the answer to the question of the meaning of our life." , " ~  Paul Tillich"], ["In this respect fundamentalism has demonic traits. It destroys the humble honesty of the search for truth, it splits the conscience of its thoughtful adherents, and it makes them fanatical because they are forced to suppress elements of truth of which they are dimly aware." , " ~  Paul Tillich"], ["Philosophy is the continuing search for life’s meaning." , " ~  Paul Tillich"], ["Our language has wisely sensed the two sides of being alone. It has created the word loneliness to express the pain of being alone. And it has created the word solitude to express the glory of being alone." , " ~  Paul Tillich"], ["He who risks and fails can be forgiven. He who never risks and never fails is a failure in his whole being." , " ~  Paul Tillich"], ["We are treating Mother Earth like a giant garbage can, and somehow we expect her to absorb the refuse without comment or retribution. …Earth has rhythm and a balance sheet, and they must be recognized on the earth’s terms." , " ~  Paul Tsongas"], ["To penetrate one’s being, one must go armed to the teeth." , " ~  Paul Valery"], ["Sometimes I think and other times I am." , " ~  Paul Valery"], ["God created man, and finding him not sufficiently alone, gave him a companion to make him feel his solitude more keenly." , " ~  Paul Valery"], ["The best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up." , " ~  Paul Valery"], ["God made everything out of nothing, but the nothingness shows through." , " ~  Paul Valery"], ["That which has always been accepted by everyone, everywhere, is almost certain to be false." , " ~  Paul Valery"], ["A poem is never finished, only abandoned." , " ~  Paul Valery"], ["Our most important thoughts are those which contradict our emotions." , " ~  Paul Valery"], ["Bloggers have worked hard to sow the seeds of a genuine, lasting progressive movement, one that transcends a given election and is concerned as much with long-term change as short-term victories." , " ~  Paul Waldman"], ["Among the core leitmotifs of conservative media is the idea of conservatives as underdogs – the notion that the real power out there rests not with the leaders of government or the captains of industry, but with a sinister cabal of liberals who somehow manage, through various techniques seldom fully revealed, to control our lives and subvert our country." , " ~  Paul Waldman"], ["Pushing the line of liberal perfidy is no easy task when your party controls all three branches of government. Since 2001, conservatives have been fighting a desperate campaign of misdirection, waving their arms furiously to keep their followers’ gaze somewhere other than at those who actually hold power." , " ~  Paul Waldman"], ["Stupidity is the world’s most dangerous disease." , " ~  Paul Waterstone"], ["But few have spoken of the actual pleasure derived from giving to someone, from creating something, from finishing a task, form offering unexpected help almost invisibly and anonymously." , " ~  Paul Weiner"], ["There is an aspiration that binds us. It is the dream of justice for a beloved community. It is the belief that extremes and excesses of inequality must be reduced so that each person is free to develop his or her full potential." , " ~  Paul Wellstone"], ["I can’t tell you how many people came up to me after the election and said, “Senator, I don’t agree with you on most issues, but I voted for you because of the way you conducted your campaign. You were honest about your positions on issues and you didn’t engage in personal attacks.” For many voters, their choice is not about ideology — whether one is left, right, or center. It has to do with whether they think you stand up for what you believe in and that, in the end, you are standing up for them." , " ~  Paul Wellstone"], ["This time, vote for what you believe in." , " ~  Paul Wellstone"], ["Never separate the lives you live from the words you speak." , " ~  Paul Wellstone"], ["I’ve seen up close whom Congress responds to and who is left out. We will never reorder the policy and priorities unless we reorder the power." , " ~  Paul Wellstone"], ["The challenge is to make a place for all Americans at the decision-making table, to force our political leaders to listen to their concerns, and for them to take action. Renewing democracy will not happen overnight or without a very difficult fight. But it is a dream that can be realized." , " ~  Paul Wellstone"], ["The future will belong to those who have passion and are willing to work hard to make our country better." , " ~  Paul Wellstone"], ["It is not that people don’t want to change the [current money-dominated political] system, they do. The problem is that the majority of people are convinced it will never change, that big money will always run politics. This sense of powerlessness corrupts. What could be accomplished is never attempted. The challenge is to mobilize millions of Americans from all walks of life to participate actively in a historic movement to restore our democracy. We need to invite ordinary citizens back into American politics to work for what is right for our nation…The only thing that can beat money politics is a revitalized citizen politics." , " ~  Paul Wellstone"], ["The proposition that our country, with all its affluence, in a time of record economic performance, cannot afford to help children during these critical early years is unacceptable." , " ~  Paul Wellstone"], ["By accepting the Washington definition of realistic, defined by a distorted pattern of power, the media denies citizens the opportunity to be empowered with knowledge and information and to make a difference." , " ~  Paul Wellstone"], ["We do not have true democracy because our political system does not work for the people. Instead, well-paid corps of lobbyists and moneyed interests perpetuate the status quo.

And this cannot be done on the cheap." , " ~  Paul Wellstone"], ["We know what we need to do. We may not know all the answers, but we know enough of them that we have no excuse not to act. Too many focus on the difficulty of the problem merely as a means of evading responsibility." , " ~  Paul Wellstone"], ["President Clinton and his successor have proclaimed welfare reform a huge success, citing a 50 percent reduction in the case rolls. But what about reducing poverty? That is the key question. Where are the seven million women and children no longer on welfare? What kinds of jobs do the mothers have? Are they living-wage jobs? Do the families still have health care coverage (Medicaid coverage came with AFDC, which had been gutted)? Most important, what kind of child care is available? Are the children safe?" , " ~  Paul Wellstone"], ["Except in the very short run, diversion [programs for wayward youth] is cost-effective, and it is also the right thing to do. Investing in services to divert troubled children now makes much more sense than investing in jails to house them later." , " ~  Paul Wellstone"], ["A politics that is not sensitive to the concerns and circumstances of people’s lives, a politics that does not speak to and include people, is an intellectually arrogant politics that deserves to fail." , " ~  Paul Wellstone"], ["We need to recall the values that have throughout our history spurred broad-based movement for change." , " ~  Paul Wellstone"], ["In the new century, we must sound the clarion call to improve the human condition." , " ~  Paul Wellstone"], ["I am emotional about all the pain I’ve seen — so many broken lives, broken dreams, broken families.

This was my dream." , " ~  Paul Wellstone"], ["I was more angry than frightened. I could not believe that vulnerable people who were sick, especially my own brother, could be treated so badly. These visits were a radicalizing experience.
